--Purpose:  The query returns students that should be on the Dean's list (Dean's List indicator on SHAINST and GPA < 3.999999999)
 --         and President's List (Dean's List indicator on SHAINST and GPA = 4.0) by prompted term.  
 --  Note:  Dean's list indicator is used because it guarantees that the student is degree seeking. 
 --  Note:  The list is sorted by academic standing then last name.
