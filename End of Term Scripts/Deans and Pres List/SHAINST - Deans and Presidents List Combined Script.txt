--   Date:  06-JUN-2019
--Purpose:  The query returns students that should be on the Dean's list (Dean's List indicator on SHAINST and GPA < 3.999999999)
 --         and President's List (Dean's List indicator on SHAINST and GPA = 4.0) by prompted term.  
 --  Note:  Dean's list indicator is used because it guarantees that the student is degree seeking. 
 --  Note:  The list is sorted by academic standing then last name.

 Edited on 2/3/2021 by Trey Dalton, TSD Systems Analyst
 Added "address" subtable to pull address information from SPRADDR
 
 Edited on 12/16/2021 by Kevin Thomas, Registrar
 Added filter to exclude studetnt that have the confidentiality indicator checked on SPAIDEN
 Changed code to look for PL or DL on SHAINST now as the Presidents List setup is complete.  
 Changed sort to Academic Standing, Last Name, First Name
