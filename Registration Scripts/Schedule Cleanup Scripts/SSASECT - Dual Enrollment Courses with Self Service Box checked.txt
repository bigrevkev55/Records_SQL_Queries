--Purpose: This query returns Dual Enrollment 
--         courses (by prompted term) in SSASECT that DO have the
--         voice response and self service box checked.
--         We do not want these sections to have this box checked 
--         as a check in this box allows sections to be seen in 
--         self-service Banner.
