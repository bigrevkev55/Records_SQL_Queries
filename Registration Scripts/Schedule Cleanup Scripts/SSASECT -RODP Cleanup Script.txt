--Description:  
--Use this script to find RODP courses by prompted term that do not have
--the "Tuition and Fee Waiver" box checked in SSASECT.
--Edits:  Created a Union to join two more queries.  
--          1.  A Query that looks for RODP Sections that do not have the correct Part of Term (R%) (PoT on SSASECT)
--          2.  A query that looks for RODP sections that do not have the correct Campus Code (%R)...kt...12-DEC-2020
--        Created a Union to join a query that looks for RODP sections that D2L listed as a integration partner.  
--          Accoring to TSD (Troy Valentine) thiese need to be removed so that these sections don't get pulled into the 
--          D2L system...kt...2/26/21
--        Changed the name of the query to "RODP Cleanup Script" from "RODP Missing Tuition and Fee Waiver Box"...kt...2.26.21
--        Added a Order by clause to order by CRNs as some CRNs have multiple issues...kt...2.26.21
