One of the things you’ll want to do for Slate setup is to import several Banner validation tables as prompts.  
The code below will work in SQL Developer to extract the data preformatted so it can be imported into Slate.  
I’m sure we’re not 100% on this yet, but basically, all you have to do is change the Key, Value, and Export fields 
then change the from statement to the correct validation table.  If you need a 
where statement, just drop the first semicolon and add your conditions
