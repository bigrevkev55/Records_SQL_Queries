--AUTHOR:    KEVIN THOMAS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OR RECORDS AND REGISTRATION
--Edited BY: Chuck Hackney (wrote subquery and joined to outer query on PIDM)
--DATE:      JANUARY 3, 2019
--PURPOSE:   THIS SCRIPT LOOKS FOR WARRANTY GRADUATES WHO BEGAN NSCC IN 
--           201880 OR LATER AND HAVE COMPLETED AN ELIGIBLE PROGRAM (cert OR aas).
--           THE QUERY ONLY LOOKS FOR NEW FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND NEW TRANSFER STUDENTS.
--           Some lines have been commented out to have less output.  However, to verify that the 
--           result set is correct simply "un-comment out" those lines.  
--	     Edited out unnecessary certificate codes, left only 'AAS', 'CRT1', 'CRT2' AK 1/15/20
