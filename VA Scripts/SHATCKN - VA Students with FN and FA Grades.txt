--Source:  From Trey Dalton's edits below.  Edited just to find VA Students to have FA or FN. 
--         This script isn't concerned with incongruent attendance/grade reporting.
--Purpose: This query returns VA students who have a FA or FN current grade, by prompted term.



/*
This report attempts to find students whose reported grade for a class isn't    ----edited by Trey Dalton, Systems Analyst II 6.10.21
compatible with their reported engagement for that class i.e. they received 
an FN grade, but were marked as attending that class, or they have a B grade, 
and were marked as not attending.
