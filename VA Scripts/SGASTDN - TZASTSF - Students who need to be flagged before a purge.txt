--   Name:  Kevin Thomas, Assistant Registrar
--   Date:  06-DEC-2019
--Purpose:  Use before a purge as this query returns students who need 
--          to be flagged on TZASTSF because they
--          have a vet type on SGASTN but have not
--          been flagged on TZASTSF to prevent them from being purged.  
--
--   Note:  There are several different queries that have been commented out that
--          give additional information.  For instance, the top query can be 
--          uncommented out to find all the students who have a "V" deferment on TZASTSF.
