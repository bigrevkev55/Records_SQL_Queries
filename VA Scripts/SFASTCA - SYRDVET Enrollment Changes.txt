-- Author: Kevin Thomas, Assitant Director of Records and Registration
--   Date: 28-OCT-2019
--Purpose:  This script will return a list of all students receiving VA benefits that have enrollment status changes on SFAREGS/SFASTCA.
--   Note:  This script was written to assist in working the daily SYRDVET report.  When prompted for a date
--          enter the last day VA once enrollment status changes were made.
--  Edits:  1. Added the following line in the select statement:  SFRSTCA_MESSAGE as "Message",
--          which will allow us to see any messages given (including final grade updates)...kt...12/9/19
--          2. Added DESC STVCAMP, Campus Code, Campus Description, and changed the script to only look for 
--             SFRSTCA_RSTS_CODE not like 'R%'  (courses that students have dropped or withdrawn from.)..kt..12/9/2020   
--          3. Added subquery to exclude entered grades from showing and clogging up the report...kt...3/25/2021
