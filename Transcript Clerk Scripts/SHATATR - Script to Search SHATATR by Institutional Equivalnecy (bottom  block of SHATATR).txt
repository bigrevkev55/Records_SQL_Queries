--     Purpose:  This script searches SHATATR equivalency block (bottom block) by prompted transfer school code, 
--               NSCC subject code, and NSCC course code.  It returns all the transfer courses that that course 
--               has been equated to at that school. This script searches SHATATR by bottom Block (INSTUTIONAL EQUIVALENCY). 

--        Note:  USE THIS SCRIPT TO SEARCH FOR OLD NSCC COURSE RUBRICS IN THE BOTTOM BLOCK OF SHATATR THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED TO 
--               UPDATED COURSE RUBRICS, OR TO SEE WHICH COURSES AT THE TRANFERS SCHOOL EQUATES TO NSCC COURSES

--        Edit:  Joined STVSBGI and shrtatc on school code to pull in the school name as "Description"...kt...3/11/21

--Instructions:  When prompted, enter the transfer school code and the NSCC Subject and Course codes.
