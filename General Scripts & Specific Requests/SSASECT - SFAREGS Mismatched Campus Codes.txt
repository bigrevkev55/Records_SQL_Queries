--Purpose:  This query returns CRNs of students whose campus code on 
--          SFAREGS does not match the campus code on SSASECT.  This is
--          due to the fact when departments update SSASECT, SFAREGS does
--          not update for students who have already registered for
--          section.  Use this output to go to SFAREGS and re-register 
--          the students to get the correct campus code.
