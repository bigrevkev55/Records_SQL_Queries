Kevin,

TBR is requesting headcount and credit hour data for particular dates for Summer 2019 to conduct comparative analyses. We only have certain days worth of frozen data.

Can you run a report that gives the headcount and total hours enrolled for Summer 2019 term as of the following dates:
5/3/2019
5/10/2019
6/7/2019
6/14/2019
6/21/2019
6/28/2019
7/5/2019
7/12/2019
Thanks for your help!

Have a great weekend and be well.

Best,
Charles
