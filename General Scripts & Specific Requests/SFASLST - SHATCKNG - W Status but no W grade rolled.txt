--Purpsoe:  Looking for students who have a 'AU' OR 'W%' Registration Status on SFASLST but no W grade OR AU grade.  
--   Note:  As of 06-May-2019 Chuck Hackney has added this as a nightly Automic process and edited it to insert a grade of 'W'
--          in SFRSTCR_GRDE_CODE column (SFASLST 'Status' field) where SFRSTS_CODE = 'W' (SFASLST Final Grade' field).
--          He did not include 'AU' grades as it would have 
--          to be a second Automic process.  There are very few 'AU' grades and we can 
--          run this script to identify those students and manually insert the 'AU' grade.   
--   Edit:  Changed where clause to sfrstcr_term_code = :Term Code from hard coded sfrstcr_term_code = '201910'...kt...12/9/19
