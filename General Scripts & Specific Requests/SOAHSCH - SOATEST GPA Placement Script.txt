Subject: high school gpa request
 
Based on this new rule that is coming out from TBR, I’d like to know how many summer and fall applicants have a high school gpa of 3.6. They have to graduate from high school from 2015 to present (SORHSCH_GRADUATION_DATE). I’d like to exclude people that have already been placed based ACT or Accuplacer. Those people would have a (SORTEST_TESC_CODE) DSPM, DSPR, or DSPW score (SORTEST_TEST_SCORE) of 4 on SOATEST. They may have one score of 4 and the other as 2. 

It may be best to send me a file with A numbers and show me everyone in the above criteria that has a 2 for at least one of the DSP levels or no DSP levels at all. 

Feel free to call me if you have questions. 615-364-9552.

Laura
