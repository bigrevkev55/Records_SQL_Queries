--Purpose:  The query returns students that should be on the Dean's list (>= 3.5 GPA, Degree seeking, half time at minimum, only for college level courses) for the Marketing Department.
--Includes students' local address
 --  Note:  Dean's list indicator is used because it guarantees that the student is degree seeking. 
 --  Note:  The list is sorted by last name then first name.
