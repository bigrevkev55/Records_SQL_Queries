--Purpose:  This query looks at SCABASE and SCADETL for course rubrics that do not have
--          a general education attribute and are new as of 201480.  This is for electronic transcripts         
--          XML downloads.  These courses will need to be 
--          checked on SHATATR for TN CCs to make sure they are 
--          built correctly.
--          General education attributes are excluded as those have already been updated on 
--          SHATATR.
--          Remove concatenation pikes (||) to divide out data. Additionally, Cooperative Education courses have 
--          been removed as students are not transferring those courses.
