        /*  
Hi Kevin,
Let me explain why we need this information- this is a program that currently exists with Clarksville Montgomery Schools
and Austin Peay. It is targeted towards graduating seniors and classified Clarksville Mongomery staff who want to become 
teachers. They work during the day as teacher aides and take their classes in the late afternoon. This will be an 
accelerated AST degree( 1.5 years for completion for students and we need to offer the courses in different modes 
of delivery- on ground, hybrid, online and in different terms. Students would then go to Austin Peay for their bachelor's
degree.

The information that you will provide will help us determine the right "mix" to present to Clarksville.

Thanks so much for your help,
Kim*/
